# Venue information - travel to and from, local entertainment, and transportation.

## Davis itself

Davis is a lovely town, with a walking-friendly downtown that has lots
of restaurants, bars, and boutiques.  The Davis Farmer's Market takes

## Travel to and from Davis.

Davis is located about 60 miles north of the Bay Area and 20 miles west of
Sacramento.

Davis can be reached in about 30 minutes from the Sacramento
International Airport (SMF), and is about an hour away from Oakland
Airport (OAK?), and between 2 and 3 hours away from the San Francisco
airport (SFO).  There is frequent serious highway congestion between Davis
and the Bay Area which should be accounted for in travel plans.

Public transportation from OAK and SFO is possible via BART (metro)
and Amtrak, which arrives in downtown Davis.  While much of downtown
Davis is walkable, lodging is typically further and we recommend
using ride sharing or taxi services.

The Davis Airporter (@@) and Supershuttle (@@) can be used for
transportation to and from airports, but should be reserved well in
advance.  Ride sharing (Uber, Lyft) works well for local travel
(to/from SMF).

## Transportation needs in Davis

A car is typically not needed in Davis, as the weather is almost
always good.  On campus housing is a short walk from drugstores and
supermarkets, and a medium walk (~20 minutes) to downtown.  Davis is
very bike friendly and bike rentals are available on a daily or weekly
basis (@@).

The venue for the Summer Institute is the Valley Hall (@@) teaching
facility, located on the Health Sciences side of UC Davis main campus.
It should be no more than a 15 minute walk from any on-campus housing,
and no more than a 25 minute bike ride from any locations in Davis.
During the summer there is ample on-site parking for about $7/day.
Breakfasts, lunches and dinners will be close to the workshop rooms
and lodging.

## Special requirements

Any special requirements (whether dietary, transportation, or family related)
should be communicated to dibsi.training@gmail.com.  We will strive to
be accomodating!
