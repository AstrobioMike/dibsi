# 2017 Data Intensive Biology Summer Institute at UC Davis

From June 18 to July 21, 2017, we'll be running several different
computational training events at the University of California, Davis
-- a two-week workshop for biologists to learn basic bioinformatics
and high performance computing, a week-long instructor training in how to reuse our
materials, and several other focused workshops.

All of this will be taking place at the UC Davis School of Veterinary
Medicine, on the main campus of UC Davis (in Davis,
CA). [Read more...](VENUE.html)

Everyone is welcome, from everywhere! Grad students, postdocs,
faculty, staff, industry, non-profits, teachers, journalists, and
grant managers may all find these workshops useful. **We welcome
applications from international students and regard the current
policies of the United States with frustration and dismay.**

Each workshop costs between $350 and $500, and room & board will be
about $500/week for non-local attendees.

### Are you an undergraduate interested in a summer research experience? 

We are launching a summer research program for students from groups 
historically underrepresented in biology. Summer interns will particpate 
in DIBSRP and an 8-10 week mentored research project in data biology (i.e. metagenomics, 
transcriptomics, etc.). More info [here](DIBSRP.html); if you have questions 
send us an e-mail at [dibsrp@gmail.com](mailto:dibsrp@gmail.com). 

### Are you interested in joining us as an instructor or a TA?

We are looking for people to join us - see our
[getting involved](getting-involved.html) page! (We will cover travel,
room and board.)
