# 2017 Data Intensive Biology Summer Institute at UC Davis

From June 18 to July 21, 2017, we'll be running several different
computational training events at UC Davis -- a two-week workshop for
biologists to learn basic bioinformatics and computing, a week-long
instructor training in how to reuse our materials, and several other
focused workshops.

All of this will be taking place at the UC Davis School of Veterinary
Medicine, on the main campus of UC Davis (in Davis,
CA). [Read more...](VENUE.html)

Everyone is welcome, from everywhere! Grad students, postdocs,
faculty, staff, industry, non-profits, teachers, journalists, and
grant managers may all find these workshops useful. [Read more...](ATTENDEES.html)

The cost for each workshop should be about $500 for room & board (if
you're not local), and a $500 workshop fee, depending on the workshop.
