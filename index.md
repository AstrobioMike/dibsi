# 2017 Data Intensive Biology Summer Institute at UC Davis

## What's DIBSI?

From June 18 to July 21, 2017, we'll be running many different
computational training events at UC Davis -- a two-week workshop for
biologists to learn basic bioinformatics and computing, a week-long
instructor training in how to reuse our materials, and several more
focused workshops on specific topics.

All of this will be taking place at the UC Davis School of Veterinary
Medicine, on the main campus of UC Davis (in Davis, CA).

Everyone is welcome, from everywhere! Grad students, postdocs,
faculty, staff, industry, non-profits, teachers, journalists, and
grant managers may all find these workshops useful.

The cost for each workshop should be about $500 for room & board (if
you're not local), and a $500 workshop fee, depending on the workshop.
