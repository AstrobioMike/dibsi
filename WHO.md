# DIBSI - Who are we?

The Data Intensive Biology Summer Institute is part of the
[Data Intensive Biology training program](https://dib-training.readthedocs.org/)
at UC Davis, run by [the DIB lab](http://ivory.idyll.org/lab).

## Partners and other UC Davis training

We are institutional partners with
[Data Carpentry](http://www.datacarpentry.org/) and
[Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org/).

The
[UC Davis Bioinformatics Core](http://bioinformatics.ucdavis.edu/training/)
also runs training!

## DIBSI leadership

### Associate Director

Dr. Phillip T. Brooks, postdoctoral fellow.

Phillip holds a PhD from Michigan State University in Comparative 
Medicine and Integrative Biology where he worked on interactions between the 
microbiome and host immune system. He now conducts research in microbiome data 
analysis and teaching/training in bioinformatics and genomics at the UC Davis 
School of Veterinary Medicine.

### Assessment and Evaluation

Dr. Karen R. Word, postdoctoral fellow.


Karen received her PhD at UC Davis in environmental physiology,
examining connections between energy expenditure and stress
endocrinology.  She now works with Dr. Brown on developing
instructional strategies for "training the trainers", effective
computational teaching, and evaluation and assessment.

### TA and Instructor Coordination

Lisa J. Cohen, graduate student.

Lisa is working on her PhD in Dr. Brown's lab, working on environmental
molecular biology and large-scale bioinformatics.
