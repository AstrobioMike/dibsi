# 2017 - Materials

## DIBSI 2017 is now over!

Planning for [DIBSI 2018](../index.html) has now begun!

Please see [the DIBSI announce
forum](https://groups.io/g/dibsi-announce/topics) for announcements regarding
future Data Intensive Biology Summer Institutes.  You can subscribe to

## 2017 Data Intensive Biology Summer Institute at UC Davis

From June 19 to July 21, 2017, we'll be running several different
computational training events at the University of California, Davis
-- a two-week workshop for biologists to learn basic bioinformatics
and high performance computing, a week-long instructor training in how to reuse our
materials, and several other focused workshops.

All of this will be taking place at the UC Davis School of Veterinary
Medicine, on the main campus of UC Davis (in Davis,
CA). [Read more...](VENUE.html)

Everyone is welcome, from everywhere! Grad students, postdocs,
faculty, staff, industry, non-profits, teachers, journalists, and
grant managers may all find these workshops useful. **We welcome
applications from international students and regard the current
policies of the United States with frustration and dismay.**

Each workshop costs between $350 and $500, and on-campus room & board will be
approximately $400/week for non-local attendees.

### Are you an undergraduate interested in a summer research experience?

We are launching a summer research program for students from groups
historically underrepresented in biology. Summer interns will particpate
in DIBSRP and an 8-10 week mentored research project in data biology (i.e. metagenomics,
transcriptomics, etc.). More info [here](DIBSRP.html); if you have questions
send us an e-mail at [dibsrp@gmail.com](mailto:dibsrp@gmail.com).
