## Basic workshop information

All workshops will take place at UC Davis; please see [the venue information](VENUE.html) for details.

Workshops may extend into the evening hours; please plan on devoting the
entire time to the workshop.  Workshops are $350/wk.

On-campus housing information is available for approximately $400/wk,
which includes breakfast and dinner. ***Housing registration has been 
extended to May 9th.***

###  Undergraduate Curriculum Hackathon

Dates: July 10-14

Organizers: David Still, Andreas Madlung, Amy Runck, Phillip Brooks,
Karen Word, Lisa Cohen, Jessica Mizzi, Alexandra
Colón-Rodríguez

Contact: [Karen Word](mailto:krlizars@ucdavis.edu)
 
Do you wish there was an undergrad-friendly version of your favorite
part of the
[two-week intro bioinformatics workshop, ANGUS](http://ivory.idyll.org/dibsi/ANGUS.html)?
Help us make one!  We're looking to bring together data experts with
teaching interests together with teaching experts with data interests
for a week of collaborative conversion of these materials into
smoothed-out tutorials for use in undergraduate classrooms. Depending
on the number of people attending and the interest they bring, we will
work on one or more of the following topic areas: Genome assembly,
RNAseq analysis and/or 16s rRNA microbial community analysis.
 
Attendees should have some familiarity with the NGS workshop materials
(perfect for those who have just taken it!) and attendees with
professional expertise in the topic areas are particularly welcome. We
will provide basic training in the use of GitHub for collaborative
work. Funding options and strategies to broaden opportunities for
bioinformatics in undergraduate settings will be discussed.

### Introduction to Python

Dates: July 10-14

Instructor: [Emily Dolson](mailto:EmilyLDolson@gmail.com)

This workshop will introduce students to the general-purpose
programming language, Python. Attendees will be researchers with
problems that could be solved with programming, such as simple
automated text-mining tasks, visualization of complex data, or
pipeline scripting across a large-scale data set. As time permits, the
Python scientific ecosystem (pandas, numpy, scipy, seaborn,
matplotlib, etc) will be introduced to get learners up to speed on the
ins and outs of using the tools that are currently most popular.

Before the workshop begins, each learner may identify a problem that
they would like to be able to solve with programming and run it by the
instructor: Emily Dolson (Michigan State University),
EmilyLDolson@gmail.com, who will then focus the workshop around
teaching the appropriate skills and coming up with challenge problems
to meet the needs of the attendees.

### Cloud Training Materials Development 

Dates: July 10-14

Organizers: Daniel Standage, Luiz Irber

Contact: [Daniel Standage](mailto:daniel.standage@gmail.com)

The demand for skills in cloud computing has steadily grown in recent
years as data collection and computing needs outstrip campus computing
capacity. For a researcher making their first foray into cloud
computing, it can be daunting to navigate the available options for
generic computing infrastructure (AWS, Google Compute, Jetstream,
etc), software application configuration (pre-configured VMs, Docker
containers, etc), data storage/archival, workflow execution, and
domain-specific platforms (Seven Bridges, DNA Nexus, etc). The lack of
training resources in this area presents a significant opportunity to
do it right. As part of the DIBSI Summer Institute, we are running a
1-week workshop (July 10th-14th) to develop training materials for
these topics. Motivated by a common genomics use cases, we will
brainstorm to identify the critical competencies needed to make
informed decisions about computing resources for data analysis in the
cloud. The key deliverable of the workshop will be a set of training
materials that we will pilot in a cloud computing workshop in the
following months.

## Week 2 - July 17-21

These workshops will start on Monday, July 17th at 9am, and finish by
Friday, July 21st, at noon.

Note that on campus housing is available from Sunday, July 16th,
through July 21st.

### Environmental Metagenomics (DIBSI-EM)

Dates: July 17-21

Instructor: [Harriet Alexander](mailto:harriet.xander@gmail.com)

Microorganisms live in complex mixed communities, and many of them
cannot be cultured. Metagenomics, or the untargeted (whole metagenome)
sequencing of genetic material (DNA) from the environment, provides a
means of assessing the genetic diversity and functional potential of
these organisms, whilst eliminating the need for isolating these
difficult to culture organisms.
 
We will be offering a five day workshop on Environmental Metagenomics
(July 17-21) as part of DIBSI 2017. This workshop is geared towards
those new to metagenomic analyses, but who have data in-hand, as well
as those interested in gaining a better understanding of some of the
approaches and learning new techniques. The workshop will be broken
into two main parts. The first two (three) days will focus on
introducing and familiarizing participants with analytical tools and
pipelines common to metagenomics through a series of hands-on
practical tutorials using a practice dataset. Topics covered will
include: short-read quality control and trimming, assembly, binning,
annotation, abundance estimation, and data visualization. The second
two (three) days will offer participants the opportunity to apply the
topics covered during the first two days of the workshop to their own
data with the support of other participants and the instructors.

This workshop will not cover 16s data analysis.

### Non-model RNAseq, bring your own data

Dates: July 17-21

Instructors: Tessa Pierce, Jane Khudyakov, Lisa Cohen

Contact: [Lisa Cohen](mailto:ljcohen@ucdavis.edu)

The focus of this hands-on tutorial will be RNAseq de novo assembly
and quantification. It is intended for participants with Illumina
poly(A) selected RNA sequencing data from a non-model organism with no
closely-related reference genome who would like assistance analyzing
and learning more about the software tools commonly used in this type
of analysis. Time will be spent working on data brought by attendees
with the idea to get through all steps of a typical pipeline
workflow. We will provide scripts, example sets of data to work with,
and cloud computing resources. Attendees should already have
some familiarity with using command line software tools and
beginning-level next-generation sequence analysis materials (see
http://ivory.idyll.org/dibsi/ANGUS.html). This workshop is ideal for
alumni of previous years of the ANGUS workshop at MSU Kellogg
Biological Station or attendees from this year's 2-week workshop at UC
Davis. We will provide basic training in the use of GitHub for
collaborative work. If you would like assistance adapting our
materials to run on the computing resources at your home institution,
please let us know.

### Introduction to R

Dates: July 17-21

Instructor: [Michael Koontz](mailto:mikoontz@gmail.com)

Join us for an interactive, week-long introduction to the programming
language R!

R is a powerful, cross-platform, open-source, and free software that
has been widely adopted across a number of science fields. While
incredibly useful, it can also be daunting to learn. This course
doesn't require any prior programming experience. We'll teach you the
basics of R by writing code together and setting up our computers the
same way you will to work on your own data after the workshop. By the
end of the week, you'll be able to input, organize, and summarize data
in R. You'll also learn how to visualize and present data using
publication-quality plots and dynamic documents that combine
descriptive writing with the results of your code.

The course will focus on laying a groundwork of basic R skills to
enable future self-teaching of specific use cases. However, enrollees
are encouraged to reach out to the instructor if there are particular
topics that they think would be especially valuable to cover, and
we'll try to work them into the curriculum.
