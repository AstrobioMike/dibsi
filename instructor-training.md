# Instructor training

June 19-June 23, 2017.

Instructors: Lex Nederbragt, Karen Word, and C. Titus Brown

This workshop is intended for people interested in teaching, reusing
and repurposing the
[Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org/lessons/),
[Data Carpentry](http://www.datacarpentry.org/lessons/), or
[Analyzing High Throughput Sequencing Data](https://angus.readthedocs.io/en/2016/)
materials.  We envision this course being most useful to current
teaching-intensive faculty, future teachers and trainers, and core
facilities that are developing training materials.

Attendees will learn about and gain practice implementing evidence-based teaching practices.  Common pitfalls specific to novice-level
instruction and bioinformatics in particular will be discussed, along
with associated troubleshooting strategies. Content used in prior
[ANGUS](ANGUS.html) workshops will be used for all practice
instruction, and experienced instructors will be on hand to address
questions about implementation.

Attendees of this workshop may opt to remain at the following
[ANGUS](ANGUS.html) two-week workshops so that they can gain hands-on
experience in preparing and teaching a lesson.

This week-long training will also serve as
[Software/Data Carpentry Instructor Training](https://swcarpentry.github.io/instructor-training/).

Attendees should have significant familiarity with molecular biology
and basic experience with the command line.

We anticipate a class size of approximately 25, with 3-6 instructors.
