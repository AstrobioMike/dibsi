# Instructor training

June 18-June 25, 2017.

Instructors: Lex Nederbragt, Karen Word, and C. Titus Brown

This workshop is intended for people interested in teaching, reusing
and repurposing the
[Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org/lessons/),
[Data Carpentry](http://www.datacarpentry.org/lessons/), or
[Analyzing Next-Generation Sequencing Data](angus.readthedocs.io/en/2016/)
materials.  We envision this course being most useful to current
teaching-intensive faculty, future teachers and trainers, and core
facilities that are developing training materials.

Attendees will learn about and gain practice implementing evidence-based     
teaching practices.  Common pitfalls specific to novice-level
instruction and bioinformatics in particular will be discussed, along
with associated troubleshooting strategies. Content used in prior
[ANGUS](ANGUS.html) workshops will be used for all practice
instruction, and experienced instructors will be on hand to address
questions about implementation.

Attendees of this workshop may opt to remain at the following
[ANGUS](ANGUS.html) two-week workshops so that they can gain hands-on
experience in preparing and teaching a lesson.

This week-long training will also serve as
[Software/Data Carpentry Instructor Training](https://swcarpentry.github.io/instructor-training/).

Attendees should have some strong familiarity with biology and basic
experience with the command line.
