# Instructor training

June 25-26, 2018.

Instructors: TBD.

Local organizer: Karen Word.

This workshop is intended for people interested in teaching, reusing
and repurposing the
[Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org/lessons/),
[Data Carpentry](http://www.datacarpentry.org/lessons/), or
[Analyzing High Throughput Sequencing Data](https://angus.readthedocs.io/en/2016/)
materials.  We envision this course being most useful to current
teaching-intensive faculty, future teachers and trainers, and core
facilities that are developing training materials.

Attendees will learn about and gain practice implementing evidence-based teaching practices.  Common pitfalls specific to novice-level
instruction and bioinformatics in particular will be discussed, along
with associated troubleshooting strategies. Content used in prior
[ANGUS](ANGUS.html) workshops will be used for all practice
instruction, and experienced instructors will be on hand to address
questions about implementation.

Attendees of this workshop should plan to remain at the following
Carpentry two-day so that they can gain hands-on experience in
preparing and teaching a lesson.

This two-day training will fulfill the requirements of
[Software/Data Carpentry Instructor Training](https://swcarpentry.github.io/instructor-training/).

Attendees should have significant familiarity with molecular biology
and basic experience with the command line.

We anticipate a class size of approximately 25, with 3-6 instructors.
