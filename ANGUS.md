# ANGUS: Analyzing High Throughput Sequencing Data

June 26 - July 8, 2017

[2016 materials: http://angus.readthedocs.io/en/2016/](http://angus.readthedocs.io/en/2016/)

This intensive two week summer course will introduce attendees with a
strong biology background to the practice of analyzing high-throughput
sequencing data (Illumina, PacBio, and Nanopore).  The first week will
introduce students to computational thinking and large-scale data
analysis on UNIX platforms. The second week will focus on genome and
transcriptome assembly, transcript quantitation, variant calling, and
other topics.

No prior programming experience is required, although familiarity with
some programming concepts will be helpful, and bravery in the face of the
unknown is necessary.  A year or more of graduate school in a
biological science is strongly suggested. Faculty, postdocs, and
research staff are more than welcome, as are researchers from industry.

Note that this year we have much more room for attendees!

A [draft schedule of hours for this year](SCHEDULE.html) is available.

## What will I learn if I attend?

Our goal for these two weeks is to get students to the point where
they are ready to begin analyzing their own data on a computer
cluster, and can work with help forums and online tutorials to
advance their own skills.

Students will gain practical experience in:

- Python and bash shell scripting
- Cloud computing/Amazon EC2
- Basic software installation on UNIX
- Installing and running Trinity, BWA, Salmon, SPAdes, ABySS, Prokka and other bioinformatics tools.
- Querying mappings and evaluating assemblies
- Materials from previous courses are available at

## [Apply here!](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSchSuErTHw9aleA_peGZsXwFHiXmr2GM4OMqgFxqY03DGiL-g/viewform)

Applications will close **March 17th**.

The course fee will be $500 for this workshop.  If you are staying in
campus housing, room and board is approximately $500/wk additional
(see [venue information](VENUE.html)).

## History

This workshop was run at Michigan State University's Kellogg
Biological Station from 2010 and 2016, with support from the USDA and
NIH (see [Funders](FUNDERS.html)).  Dr. Brown is the founding course
director and ran the workshop from 2010-2015; Dr. Staton (UTK) and
Dr. MacManes (UNH) were the 2016 course directors.

There are now almost 200 alumni of the first 7 years!

With Dr. Brown's move to UC Davis, the workshop has expanded to serve
more learners, and to include more activities.
