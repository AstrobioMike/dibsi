# CarpentryConnect Davis 2018

_Note: This is a small regional Carpentry conference, just rebranded
from CarpentryCon West to CarpentryConnect Davis; if you are looking
for the international CarpentryCon event taking place in Dublin on 30
May - 1 June, 2018, please visit
[carpentrycon.org](http://www.carpentrycon.org/)._

## You're invited!

We’re inviting Carpentries folks of all stripes — from new fans to veteran community-members, from all disciplines, near and far — to join us for CarpentryConnect Davis! We’ve got housing and space for [DIBSI 2018](http://ivory.idyll.org/dibsi/), our annual bioinformatics summer institute, so we’ve set aside **Friday evening through Sunday morning, June 29-July 1**, for a Carpentries gathering in sunny Davis, California.
