# Getting involved

We are seeking lead instructors [ANGUS](angus.html) (June 26-July 8),
teaching assistants for some or all of June 26-July 21, and workshop
leaders for one-week workshops between July 10-July 21.

[Indicate interest here!](@@)

## What's in it for me?

Here is our sales pitch for your time:

* Everyone participating will have travel and lodging reimbursed, of course.

* Lead instructors and workshop leaders will receive an honorarium,
  funds and employment status permitting.

* Learning by teaching!

* Networking with instructors and students, and maybe finding that next
  job (or job candidate).

* We can arrange a day or two off to explore Northern California
  (see [Venue](VENUE.html)).

## What experience should I have?

As our workshops are "Carpentry style", we strongly prefer to recruit
badged Software and Data Carpentry instructors for all roles.

Lead instructors should have some significant genomics or bioinformatics
hands-on experience, although it need not be very broad.

Workshop leaders should be knowledgeable in the subject area of their
workshop.

TAs need not be particular experts but should be familiar with git and
the UNIX command line.

## Anything else I should know?

All material generated and used during the workshop must be licensed
under an open license (generally CC-BY).

We're hoping to provide digital badges acknowledging your roles!
