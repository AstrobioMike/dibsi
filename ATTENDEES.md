# Information for attendees

## Code of conduct

We operate under a code of conduct. @

CoC resolution info. @

## Pace and expertise levels

The core workshops are "zero entry", and assume no background in
computing.  Especially at the beginning this means that many attendees
may find the pace rather slow.  However, we believe that getting
everyone on the same page is important, and we also find that going
slowly as needed sets a positive tone, makes sure no one is left
behind, allows for questions, and creates a solid base for forward
progress.

More advanced attendees are welcome to attend, but we ask that they
participate fully in activities.  Attendees who regularly lapse in
workshop tutorials may be asked to stop coming to the workshop.

## Local attendees and workshop hours

Workshops will start mid-morning (9am) and potentially run late (with
events after dinner). A core part of these workshops has traditionally
been networking and informal interactions.

We strongly recommend that people stay no more than 30 minutes travel
time away from UC Davis - this means Davis, Sacramento, Woodland, and
other local towns.  Note that the on-campus lodging should be
competitive with local hotels and AirBNBs.

## Remove attendance

We do not currently support remote attendance.

## Registration fees - what does my $$ get me?

In order to enable the most people to come for the lowest price, we charge
a free for registration $@@ and workshop attendance.

Your registration money primarily pays for instructor and TA travel,
room, and board, as well as lead instructor honoraria.

We try to operate at cost, which means we have thin margins; we are
supplemented by some grant money, but that by no means can cover everything.
(See FUNDERS.)

We have some (limited) financial aid available; please inquire at
dibsi.training@gmail.com.

There are various deadlines associated with registration and housing;
once past the deadline, fees already paid cannot be refunded.
