From July 10-July 21, we are planning to run a variety of workshops at
the
[Data Intensive Biology Summer Institute](http://ivory.idyll.org/dibsi/).

Below are our plans.
[Please let us know if you are interested!](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfcLYvOvg_v-ALK4Rgt6eyrWcPpFYVMhmiiwFdJAaMYPnbI4w/viewform)

## Confirmed / highly likely

### GWAS on veterinary genomes (Tamer and Erica)

A hands-on tutorial for doing Genome Wide Association Studies using 
Illumina sequence.

### Shotgun environmental -omics / bring your own data (Harriet)

A hands-on tutorial for working with shotgun meta-omic data from the
environment.  Will contain room for working with data brought by
attendees.  Note: for shotgun data, *not* 16S/amplicon data.

### Binder workshop (Titus and Luiz)

A workshop to extend [binder](http://mybinder.org/), cloud-deployed
Docker+Jupyter Notebook.  (See
[this workshop grant](http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/2016-mybinder-workshop-proposal.html)
for more specifics.)

## Strong potential

### A week of MinHash - barnraising

Using mash, sourmash, or other MinHash sketch software for doing
genome similarity search? Want to talk with others, develop ideas, or
rough out a sequence search solution for your research question?
Come!

### Non-model RNAseq / bring your own data

A hands-on tutorial for working with RNAseq assembly and quantification.
Will contain room for working with data brought by attendees.

### Introduction to R

'nuff said. A full week of R, perhaps using the
[R for reproducible scientific analysis](https://data-lessons.github.io/gapminder-R/) lessons.

## Seeking leader and/or attendee interest.

### Developing and release open source scientific software / hackfest

A gathering of scientists who want to work on improving their software
development processes, documentation, or release process. In
particular, we could work specifically off of the Journal of Open
Source Software's
[guidelines](http://joss.theoj.org/about#author_guidelines), and
perhaps do in-workshop submission and review of JOSS publications on
attendee software.

### Introduction to Python.

'nuff said.  A full week of Python.

### Co-working space for bioinformatics

Bring your data & bring your questions, and we'll work together on
your problem.

### Lesson development for undergraduates

Work on building bioinformatics lessons for undergraduate teaching.
